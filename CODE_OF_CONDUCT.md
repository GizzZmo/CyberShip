Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

- GitHub repositories (code, issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Project documentation
- Official project communications
- Events and meetings related to the project
- Representing the project in public spaces

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

## Guidelines for Healthy Interactions
